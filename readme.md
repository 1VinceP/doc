# cheatsheets & infographics

for devmountain folks

these will tend towards the sysadmin/nix/vcs side of things

use them! download them! take them! do something like
`git clone https://github.com/zacanger/cheat-sheets-etc ~/doc` so they're always around!

all the markdown files are either original or rewritten/combined bits and pieces from other people

all the graphics should probably not be in here, since they're totally not mine
